# Blogs I like

The whole idea of this blog is also to use it as a kind of public-facing repository for my projects and thinking. It would only be complete if I'd also include some bookmarks that I find helpful.

### permacomputing
- xxiivv - an inspiring corner of the internet on the ecology of computers, sustainability, permacomputing but also on various cool artistic projects.
The following excerpt in the about section says a lot: "The aim of this wiki is to build a form of personal assistant to help with the management of a vast repository of recorded statistics which includes daily logs, notes on various projects and curated pages of general knowledge. Oscean is written in the Uxntal programming language, and designed to be maintained from low-power devices". https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html
- another site with the same person, similar topics with the creative project he and his partner do. It's an artist collective that documents low-tech solutions with the hope of building a more resilient future https://100r.co/site/home.html



### ML
- Sander Dieleman's blog https://sander.ai/. He works at Google deepmind, and writes comprehensive articles about diffusion model. I work with that a lot and find his perspectives, angles, and nuances extremely insightful. Here are a couple of posts that stood out for me: 
  - [Generative modelling in latent space](https://sander.ai/2025/04/15/latents.html)
  - [Diffusion is spectral autoregression](https://sander.ai/2024/09/02/spectral-autoregression.html)
  - [Noise Schedulers considered harmfull](https://sander.ai/2024/06/14/noise-schedules.html) 
- Lilian Weng's blog https://lilianweng.github.io . She has good posts about large language models. I liked one post on inference/training efficiency of the transformer architecture.
