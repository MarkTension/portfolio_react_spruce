# Blogs I like

The idea of this blog is to have a public-facing repository for all my projects and thinking. To share what I'm thinking about, and notes on what I've learned. 

It would only be complete if I'd also include my favorite information sources. I like personal blogs specifically, instead of papers, the feed, or company websites, because they're less 'designed by commitee'. Less polished, more opinionated; more intellectually prickly.

### permacomputing
- xxiivv - an inspiring corner of the internet on the ecology of computers, sustainability, permacomputing but also on various cool artistic projects.
The following excerpt in the about section says a lot: "The aim of this wiki is to build a form of personal assistant to help with the management of a vast repository of recorded statistics which includes daily logs, notes on various projects and curated pages of general knowledge. Oscean is written in the Uxntal programming language, and designed to be maintained from low-power devices". https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html
- another site with the same person, similar topics with the creative project he and his partner do. It's an artist collective that documents low-tech solutions with the hope of building a more resilient future https://100r.co/site/home.html . They're releasing this low-tech software that needs a VM/emulator to run. My favorite release is ORCA, a very creative, unusual, ASCII-based music sequencer.


### ML
I like following good writers who work at the pioneering companies, sharing their way of thinking, and especially the topics they're thinking about.
Here are some of these that get regularly updated up until now.
- Sander Dieleman's blog https://sander.ai/. He works at Google deepmind, and writes comprehensive articles about diffusion model. I work with that a lot and find his perspectives, angles, and nuances extremely insightful. Here are a couple of posts that stood out for me: 
  - [Generative modelling in latent space](https://sander.ai/2025/04/15/latents.html)
  - [Diffusion is spectral autoregression](https://sander.ai/2024/09/02/spectral-autoregression.html)
  - [Noise Schedulers considered harmfull](https://sander.ai/2024/06/14/noise-schedules.html) 
- Lilian Weng's blog https://lilianweng.github.io . She has good posts about large language models. I liked one post on inference/training efficiency of the transformer architecture.
- Chris Olah's blog https://colah.github.io/ . Here I first learned about RNNs, but he's kept writing since. Really high quality stuff.
- Eugene Yan https://eugeneyan.com/ .  


### music
- Optimistic underground https://optimisticunderground.com/ . Discovered soo many new cool music via this blog. Has had a huge impact on my own musicmakings. David James, the creator of it is also cool to follow on X for album recommendations. His end of the year lists are also incredible. I just don't have enough time to actively dig into all the new music being released, so it's great to have a curator like him.
- Delayed. https://www.delayed.nyc/ . Amazing music recommendations in the area of experimental, ambient, and techno music. Also a nice selection of soundcloud mixes to listen to, especially the Sundays are for.
