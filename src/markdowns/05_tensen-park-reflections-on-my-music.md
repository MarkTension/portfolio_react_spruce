In this post I'll reflect on the unreleased 'Molasses' music album I've been trying to finish as Tensen Park. I'll try to make conscious what I've been unconsciously trying to achieve, which helps me to focus, and hopefully throw some interesting thoughts into the world.

**Subtle states**

With my music I like to take myself to new, subtle states of experience. It works best if the sounds are rich and evocative in spiking subconscious imagery. Especially the subtle states are interesting to me. These are the states that feel somewhat alien and new, not triggering strong primary emotions, but the subtle places in between. My earliest memory of such a feeling is when I listened to Boards of Canada's Music is Math for the first time. Hearing that felt like memories were triggered of a life that was not mine.

**Un-wholesome yoga music**

Still, all my explorations/songs are not about experiencing _any_ mind-state. Each song's aim is to accentuate beauty in its own way. Sometimes I jokingly explain to friends that my music is 'unwholesome-yoga-music'. I think yoga music is epitomised with the wholesome sounds played at yoga classes, creating a divine space of healing sounds to affirm the loving and warm nature of reality. When I listen to it, it feels like it tries to distill beauty to its pure form. I'm on board with this genre. However, I also like to bathe in the beauty of uncertainty, chaos, and thick molasses of condensed experience that is loaded with meaning, yet hard to dissect. This is the un-wholesome part. In some way, each song creates a different vantage point to beauty by experiencing it from its own context of subtle going-on's. I like to see my songs as entire human life-times, instantiated to experience beauty in their own authentic way, often shrouded by all other aspects of life that give it context or stand in the way of it, which imbue life with its own unique flavour and meaning.

**Methods**

When finished, I rate the success of a song by the degree of clarity in which it can trigger these subtle feelings of beauty. In my process I tend to converge to the over-saturated gritty sounds from my Korg ms-20 synthesizer, stacked in multiple layers. Then some levels of complex textures, and often a voices of a more physical instrument to create some form of linear narrative and guidance. The narrative is mostly a single repeated chant that slowly develops over time without too much on melodious development and counterpoints. Instead I spend most of my effort into trying to work-out what exactly this space is that I'm accessing, which often leads to a bunch of repetition, evolving the sonic characteristics of the instruments over time (e.g. integration, disintegration.) , and changes in perspective between foreground and background.

All in all, I might add more descriptions to this document when I have more time, but it feels quite complete for now. The album is on its way, and music can be listened to on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1lB15Q7MjR8s2j7TzeMP9Y?si=yykNVZ46TPmIMlcTGlJUDg).

Peace and partly-wholesome love,

Tensen Park
