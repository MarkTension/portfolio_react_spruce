This post was originally deployed on [escherthink.com](https://escherthink.com/), a startup I'm co-founding.
Escher Think reduces entropy in teams with ideas from collective intelligence.

This post explores two analogies for the internet:
The Borg and the Rhizome.

### The Borg
If you don't know Star Trek The Next Generation, I'm sorry for the reference.
The Borg is a humanoid alien species that has fully merged with technology.
Each individual Borg has (from birth or involuntarily) relinquised its own individuality for the shared hive-mind.
The hive mind is one big entity / computer, which moves in a big cubical ship through the universei Its mission is to assimilate other lifeforms into its system.

I think it's a good metaphore for how humans relate to the internet, and how that can go wrong.
Over the years our presence as digital entities has become almost more relevant than the physical.
The Borg takes this trend to the extreme.
Seeing the internet as a hive-mind with its own will, guided by bigger forces that steer collective thought is maybe a fitting, yet concerning way to look at it.
It gets more dystopic if the individuals that make it up are born into it. That individual thoughts are steered by larger forces that don't have the individual's best interest at heart.
This is the image that I get from the Borg.
Also with the current internet, sometimes we don't know how much we're in the flows of the bigger incentives that are at play.
Especially since big tech copmanies makes up a huge chunk of the forces on the internet.

### The Rhizome

A different analogy, coming from post-modern thinker Deleuze, is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)">Rhizome</a>. 
A rhizome is the messy underground tangle of root structures with no apparent order or coherence.

"The rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo."

I like this term because it looks at culture as a big emergent messy thing without the structure of one tree-trunk, like a tree has.
The rhizome connects any point to any other point. The internet is Rhizomatic! Make a hole in it, and it will fill up again.

The Rhizome emerges from the multiplicity of species that make it up. No hard structure is imposed.

### Looking at the web

Big tech funneling the internet through its own infrastructure and curation is a topic Bas and I often talk about.
These companies bring great services and aren't necessarily evil at heart. But there's something problematic about the potential power to control a system like the internet.
Something that we're all so deeply hooked into, controlling the streams of information that we see has huge potential for abuse.
Any person who becomes a less actualized version of themselves because their curiosity is fed with garbage is a huge waste to humanity.

Ideally there are benevolent, transparent systems in place that nourish each human's information intake.
And lately we've seen some excellent initiatives that try to do this. Open-source and open-protocol systems like Mastodon or Bluesky are good examples.
Also the idea of <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf">_local-first_</a> to replace _cloud-first_. The local-first paradigm definitely sound more Rhizomatic, less Borg to me.

I think the current nostalgia for the unfiltered, unsmoothened 90's internet hints at a need for better more transparent and noursishing infrastructure like in the chaotic past.

Anyway, I like these metaphores as they help navigating the software designing decision and consumer choices that lays the core for the more benevolent technology of the future.
