# Reality-questioning Ideas before bed

My day-to-day grind means singular focus, lots of screen-time, programming, and discussions around the ideas I'm working on.

I love the grind, but the world can feel quite small sometimes.

Since a few weeks I'm keeping up a new habit:
Around 1 hour before bed, I lay on the floor, stretch, and listen to thought provoking, reallity challenging conversations. 

These are from a curated queue of conversations I collect and get recommended by friends. All cover very diverse topics; Mostly spiritual, metaphysical, or outsider ideas on the world. All question reality in one way or another.

It's not really about finding truth, but more about postponing judgement about what reality is, and how it works. A great exercise. 

But most of all it's such a treat to the mind. To go to sleep with these mind-bending ideas. I really wake up with more excitement about life. Dreams seem to be more vivid and interesting too. Can recommend it to anyone. Here's a list to get started with this endeavor:

** Jung, UFOs, Ancient Civilizations, & Transcendence in a Secular World â€” Dr Bernardo Kastrup - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUFkhcw9Mn0 **
- The idea of human meaning in metacognition that he proposes is super powerful
- Super intrigued by the idea of a possibility of intelligent life before the dinosaurs. 
- very unique view on UAP's , based on hystorical observations and Jung.

** LAMPS Panel Discussion: Psychedelics and entities. What are they and what should we do about them? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynfua0t4Tao **
- Insane out of this world psychedelic stories and conversation about entities encounters in psychedelic realms. 

** Bernardo Kastrup and The Search for Meaning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zfPKSRU-RI **
- Besides his main idea of non-material metaphysics, his idea of meaning is super interesting. His books More than Allegory and Why Materialism is Balloney are great. Although the tone of the latter takes some time getting used to.

** Patrick Harpur | Bernardo Kastrup: Myth, Imagination & Truth - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4hEOJQpbiw **
- Patrick harpur has very interesting views on mythology, truth, and perception, and where truth and imagination collide.

** Interview | Pat Noone | Irish Fairies - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXRO2Jt-LnQ **
- Goes really well after Patrick Harpur

** Christopher M. Bache on his Journey Exploring LSD as a Practice, and Entheogens as an Actual Path - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV86_iSTEbU **
- Bache did 74 extremely high-dose LSD trips. His experiences carry a lot of significance. One of the most interesting philosophers that took his quest for truth inwards

** Lee Brown - Native American Prophecies - https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=u3mzk__aa-o **
- Not watched yet, but apparently carries some very striking predictions.

**Living with a Daimon with Bernardo Kastrup - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDjqRVTkpo0 **
- Bernardo Kastrup has many interesting ideas.

**The Power Of Myth with Joseph Campbell**
- amazing series about mythology and how myths are quite similar in many cultures throughout history.

I'll update the list. Most likely will make a playlist and link it here
