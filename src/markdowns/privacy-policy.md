# privacy policy WalkWalkWalk

Apple wants me to add a privacy policy to the app. So here it is, in my blog. 
I'll put it somewhere else later:


Privacy Policy

Effective Date: March 23 2025

[Your App Name] ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage when you use our iOS app.

Information We Do Not Collect

Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal data, usage data, or any other form of information from users. We do not track your activity, gather analytics, or request any personally identifiable information.

Third-Party Services

Since our app does not collect any data, we also do not share any information with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

Children's Privacy

Our app is designed for users of all ages and does not collect any personal information from children or adults.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any changes are made, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
