# About Me

I'm Mark Tensen, a software engineer and digital artist exploring the intersection of technology, generative systems, and creative expression.

## What I Do

My work spans several interconnected domains:

### Software Engineering & Research
I build tools and systems that push the boundaries of what's possible with code. From WebGPU compute shaders to reinforcement learning systems, I'm fascinated by the computational substrate that enables digital creativity.

### Generative Art & Artificial Life
I create digital organisms, cellular automata, and complex systems that exhibit emergent behaviors. My projects explore how simple rules can give rise to beautiful, unexpected patterns and dynamics.

### Electronic Music Production
Under the name **Tensen Park**, I produce electronic music that bridges the gap between algorithmic composition and human expression. I build custom Max4Live devices and use evolutionary algorithms to generate musical material.

### Graphics Programming
I work extensively with WebGPU, WGSL shaders, and real-time graphics systems. From neural cellular automata to particle systems, I love bringing mathematical concepts to visual life.

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Open exploration** over predetermined outcomes
- **Raw authenticity** over polished perfection  
- **Interdisciplinary thinking** that crosses traditional boundaries
- **Tools that amplify human creativity** rather than replace it

## Current Interests

- Neural cellular automata and differentiable systems
- WebGPU compute shaders for real-time simulations
- The intersection of AI and creative practice
- Building better tools for digital artists
- Exploring consciousness through computational models

## Background

I have experience in machine learning, computer graphics, and full-stack development. I've worked on everything from reinforcement learning for 3D sculpting to building chaotic oscillator networks for music production.

My blog serves as a "Memex" - a living archive of my explorations, discoveries, and evolving understanding of these interconnected fields.

## Connect

Feel free to reach out if you're working on something at the intersection of art, technology, and emergence. I'm always interested in collaborative explorations and sharing ideas.
