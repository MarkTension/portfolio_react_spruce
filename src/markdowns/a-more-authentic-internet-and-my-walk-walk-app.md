# New iOS app Walk Walk Walk, and a more authentic internet

It's early 2025 and Code-assistants are getting crazy good. 
Nowadays most technically-inclined people (even without experience) are enabled to create on the web. 
Even though I was slightly disappointed for a moment because I've lost some of my edge as an experienced developer, 
creative power to all is a very good thing. 
And actually, I get to do more side-projects like the Walk Walk Walk app, so it's a big win for me.
Any creative individual is nowadays more enabled. 

### On standing out amongst the noise
One problem is that there'll be more low-quality schlop as well.
Digital products of small companies, agents and hustler's trying to make money, etc.
The previous generation of the web was much more like a formula. Thinking along the lines of 'the perfect button', or the perfect color scheme. 

But to stand out, it will not be the utility of the new generation of apps. 
I predict authenticity and design will become even more important. Not formulaic design, but true creativity.
A human feel to everything you see, and maybe an authentic story. 
Apps can become more like art projects too.
Just like creatives had an instagram portfolio of images. Now your ig wall could be a series of apps.
Utility mixed with artistic taste is actually a very interesting thing in my opinion: Sparking some joy in mundane daily life things.

The new web will have to over-compensate for all the middle of the road, formulaic stuff out there. 
I believe people will increasingly care more about authenticity, an artisinal/hand-made feeling, novelty, and the sense that you're entering someone's world when you enter a webpage or app.

As a sidenote: the narrative of AI taking the artistic stuff away from creatives is not entirely true in this case, because it gives creative-minded people a new medium as well.

### WalkWalkWalk as an example
The app: https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/walkwalkwalk/id6742700740?l=en-GB

The iOS app I've developed called WalkWalkWalk is more a creative outlet and artistic endeavor than it is its logic.
It's a Tamagotchi-like app that allows you to set goals for walking outside daily, and counting your steps.

It started when my partner and me had Congi, the family dog, over for a month. 
We really loved the daily walks, and once he was gone our walks stopped too.
The app is a way to get those walks back into our daily life again.

The app-logic is fun, but already done before by a combination of other apps. 
The style isn't though. I wanted to style it so that it doesn't look like an iOS app.
I've drawn a lot in the past, and I've tried to really put my style into the app.

If you like the vibe, it's clear that the creator is likely a person you can relate to as well, and that could become an important feeling.
It brings some more life into our digital experience when everything is a little more animate than it used to.

I'm not necessarily predicting this app will be a big hit.
(Hopefully it will be for some people who discover that a daily walk in the sun is very enjoyable)
But in this post it serves as a good example how combining creative freedom with technology could look like.

In conclusion: 
App building should be fun, and a creative expression. 
A way to discover who you are through what you want to build, and what you end up building. 
It lets creative people who are also technically inclined build fun and useful stuff. 
I't actually much like the creative joy in roblox, or minecraft, but now mixed with real-world utility as well.
The looks of things matter a lot, and will matter more in the years to come.
