# My iOS app Walk Walk Walk, and a more authentic internet

Code-assistants are becoming crazy good. Therefore most people will be able to be creative on the web, and make web apps with little effort. Aside from the low-quality slop that is quaranteed to flood the internet, more creative power to everyone is also a good thing.

Instead of utility of the new generation of apps, I predict authenticity and design will become way more important. A human feel to everything you see, and maybe an authentic story.

The previous generation of the web was much more like a formula. Thinking along the lines of 'the perfect button', or the perfect color scheme. The new web will have to over-compensate for all the middle of the road, low quality websites out there. I believe people will increasingly care more about authenticity, an artisinal/hand-made feeling, novelty, and the sense that you're entering someone's world when you enter a webpage or app.

### Walk Walk Walk as an example
My iOS app called Walk Walk Walk is more a creative outlet and artistic endeavor than it is its logic. It's a Tamagotchi-like app that allows you to set goals for walking outside daily, and counting your steps.

The app-logic is fun, but already done before by a combination of other apps. But the style isn't. It doesn't even look like an iOS app. If you like the style, it's clear that the creator is likely a person you can relate to. I think people will value that more and more in the future. I'm not saying this app will be a big hit. Maybe it will be for some people who discover that a daily walk in the sun is very enjoyable, but in this blogpost it serves as a good example.

App building should be fun, and a creative expression. A way to discover who you are through what you want to build, and what you end up building. The looks of things matter a lot, and will matter more in the years to come.
