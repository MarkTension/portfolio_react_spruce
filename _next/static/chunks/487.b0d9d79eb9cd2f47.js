Think of the crazy colorful html business websites, insane myspace themes, and unreadable winamp skins. I can scroll the [winamp skin museum](https://skins.webamp.org/) for hours.\n\nNowadays we're converging more to a smooth and consistent 'optimal' style of webpages.\nIt has its upsides: it is more readable, and less clutered, but at the same time also less authentic and personal; Less alive.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the [dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) lately (that most interactions and things you see on the web are not humans, but generated by bots). I don't think we're there yet, but I can imagine a future in e.g. 10 years, where the mainstream web experience is like that, and only if you're really lucky, you might stumble upon a little oasis of real-human internet interaction. I think we're heading into this direction a little.\n\nThat's why I like it when I see a website nowadays that was obviously made by a human. Lately that's mostly an old professor's or programmer's blog. It's flawed in its design, but nonetheless very personal and fun. These are sites I tend to remember and revisit.\n\nTherefore I built my portfolio website without a website builder. A website builder like squarespace would've been more convenient, but the whole experience pulls you to conformist designs. You get primed from the beginning with templates and color schemes that are too perfect to deviate from. Having just code, you don't get primed this way, and you have to really use your imagination. It's more raw. The whole iterative process of building things and seeing the website change in unexpected ways reminds me of the unexpected results from creative coding or generative art.\n\nThe added upsides for me are 0 hosting costs using github pages. And I can write my blog in markdown files directly in the code editor, and deploy a new version with one command 'npm run deploy'. This makes the barrier quite low for me to write my thoughts down, or document a project.\n\nI hope this inspires someone to build their own raw and slightly ugly website and thereby create their unique corner of the internet.\n"}}]);
