It would only be complete if I'd also include some bookmarks that I find helpful.\n\n## Compute\n- xxiivv - an inspiring corner of the internet on the ecology of computers, sustainability, but also on various cool artistic projects.\nThe following excerpt in the about section says a lot: \"The aim of this wiki is to build a form of personal assistant to help with the management of a vast repository of recorded statistics which includes daily logs, notes on various projects and curated pages of general knowledge. Oscean is written in the Uxntal programming language, and designed to be maintained from low-power devices\". https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html\n\n\n## ML\n- Sander Dieleman's blog. He works at Google deepmind, and writes long articles about diffusion model. I work with that a lot and find his perspectives, angles, and nuances extremely insightful. Here are a couple of posts that stood out for me:\n  - Generative modelling in latent space - https://sander.ai/2025/04/15/latents.html\n  - Diffusion is spectral autoregression - https://sander.ai/2024/09/02/spectral-autoregression.html\n  - Noise Schedulers considered harmfull - https://sander.ai/2024/06/14/noise-schedules.html\n\n- Lilian Weng's blog https://lilianweng.github.io . She has a good post about inference/training efficiency of the transformer architecture."}}]);
