It would only be complete if I'd also include some bookmarks that I find helpful.\n\n### permacomputing\n- xxiivv - an inspiring corner of the internet on the ecology of computers, sustainability, permacomputing but also on various cool artistic projects.\nThe following excerpt in the about section says a lot: \"The aim of this wiki is to build a form of personal assistant to help with the management of a vast repository of recorded statistics which includes daily logs, notes on various projects and curated pages of general knowledge. Oscean is written in the Uxntal programming language, and designed to be maintained from low-power devices\". https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html\n- another site with the same person, similar topics with the creative project he and his partner do. It's an artist collective that documents low-tech solutions with the hope of building a more resilient future https://100r.co/site/home.html\n\n\n\n### ML\n- Sander Dieleman's blog https://sander.ai/. He works at Google deepmind, and writes comprehensive articles about diffusion model. I work with that a lot and find his perspectives, angles, and nuances extremely insightful. Here are a couple of posts that stood out for me: \n  - [Generative modelling in latent space](https://sander.ai/2025/04/15/latents.html)\n  - [Diffusion is spectral autoregression](https://sander.ai/2024/09/02/spectral-autoregression.html)\n  - [Noise Schedulers considered harmfull](https://sander.ai/2024/06/14/noise-schedules.html) \n- Lilian Weng's blog https://lilianweng.github.io . She has good posts about large language models. I liked one post on inference/training efficiency of the transformer architecture.\n\n\n### music\n- Optimistic underground https://optimisticunderground.com/ . Discovered soo many new cool music via this blog. Has had a huge impact on my own musicmakings. David James, the creator of it is also cool to follow on X for album recommendations. His end of the year lists are also incredible. I just don't have enough time to actively dig into all the new music being released, so it's great to have a curator like him.\n- Delayed. https://www.delayed.nyc/ . Amazing music recommendations in the area of experimental, ambient, and techno music. Also a nice selection of soundcloud mixes to listen to, especially the Sundays are for.\n\n"}}]);
