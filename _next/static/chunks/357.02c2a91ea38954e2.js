Thinking along the lines of \'the perfect button\', or the perfect color scheme. \n\nBut to stand out, it will not be the utility of the new generation of apps. \nI predict authenticity and design will become even more important. Not formulaic design, but true creativity.\nA human feel to everything you see, and maybe an authentic story. \nApps can become more like art projects too.\nJust like creatives had an instagram portfolio of images. Now your ig wall could be a series of apps.\nUtility mixed with artistic taste is actually a very interesting thing in my opinion: Sparking some joy in mundane daily life things.\n\nThe new web will have to over-compensate for all the middle of the road, formulaic stuff out there. \nI believe people will increasingly care more about authenticity, an artisinal/hand-made feeling, novelty, and the sense that you\'re entering someone\'s world when you enter a webpage or app.\n\nAs a sidenote: the narrative of AI taking the artistic stuff away from creatives is not entirely true in this case, because it gives creative-minded people a new medium as well.\n\n<p align="center">\n<img width= "50%" src="/images/walkwalk1.PNG" alt="congi im">\n</p>\n\n### Walk Walk Walk as an example\nThe iOS app I\'ve developed called Walk Walk Walk is more a creative outlet and artistic endeavor than it is its logic.\nIt\'s a Tamagotchi-like app that allows you to set goals for walking outside daily, and counting your steps.\n\nIt started when my partner and me had Congi, the family dog, over for a month. \nWe really loved the daily walks, and once he was gone our walks stopped too.\nThe app is a way to get those walks back into our daily life again. \n\n<p align="center">\n<img width= "50%" src="/images/walkwalk4.jpg" alt="congi im">\n</p>\n\nThe app-logic is fun, but already done before by a combination of other apps. \nThe style isn\'t though. I wanted to style it so that it doesn\'t look like an iOS app.\nI\'ve drawn a lot in the past, and I\'ve tried to really put my style into the app.\n\nIf you like the vibe, it\'s clear that the creator is likely a person you can relate to as well, and that could become an important feeling.\nIt brings some more life into our digital experience when everything is a little more animate than it used to.\n\nI\'m not necessarily predicting this app will be a big hit.\n(Hopefully it will be for some people who discover that a daily walk in the sun is very enjoyable)\nBut in this post it serves as a good example how combining creative freedom with technology could look like.\n\n<p align="center">\n<img width= "50%" src="/images/walkwalk3.jpg" alt="congi im">\n</p>\n\nIn conclusion: \nApp building should be fun, and a creative expression. \nA way to discover who you are through what you want to build, and what you end up building. \nIt lets creative people who are also technically inclined build fun and useful stuff. \nI\'t actually much like the creative joy in roblox, or minecraft, but now mixed with real-world utility as well.\nThe looks of things matter a lot, and will matter more in the years to come.\n'}}]);
