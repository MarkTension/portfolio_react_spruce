Here are a couple that stood out for me:\n- Generative modelling in latent space - https://sander.ai/2025/04/15/latents.html\n- Diffusion is spectral autoregression - https://sander.ai/2024/09/02/spectral-autoregression.html\n- Noise Schedulers considered harmfull - https://sander.ai/2024/06/14/noise-schedules.html\n\nNot strictly on Diffusion models, but Lilian Weng had a good post about inference/training efficiency of the transformer architecture. \n- https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-10-inference-optimization/"}}]);
