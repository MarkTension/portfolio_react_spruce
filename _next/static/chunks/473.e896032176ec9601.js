The entire fricking tensor.\n\nWhy? Who cares about that? Just give me the tensor shape! \nShape is all I need. It's visual, like when I work out a problem on paper.\n\nSo now I end up typing tensor.shape all the time, and that's kind of annoying.\n\nJAX got it right though. A tensor eval there is like:\n```\nJitTracer<float32[50, 3]>\n```\nAll I need!\n\nSo what I do now sometimes is this wonderfully hacky hotfix, which is also quite satisfying.\n([thank you pytorch forum](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/tensor-repr-in-debug-should-show-shape-first/147230/5))\nJust add it to the top of your script.\n\n```\nnormal_repr = torch.Tensor.__repr__\ntorch.Tensor.__repr__ = lambda self: f\"{normal_repr(self)}\\n {self.shape}\"\n```\n\nI've been too okay living with this for years. Probably because I like pytorch most of the time.\nA colleague once shared that he liked pytorch so much because he came from Tensorflow 1.\nI could really identify with that. \n\nStill, it's good to have these little epiphanies that something is annoying and actually do something about it.\n"}}]);
