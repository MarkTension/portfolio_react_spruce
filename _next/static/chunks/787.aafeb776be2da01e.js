It's been fun, and I reconnected with the part of me that wants a deeper understanding of it. During my master's in Neurophysiology we studied cell biology, but my focus then was more on modeling cognition. \n\nBut recently this desire to understand biology and evolution on a deeper level have fueled also my creative endeavors in this topic. \n\nI've been listening to podcasts with Michael Levin, where he goes in depth into how cell intelligence arises. He discusses some fascinating bio-electrical mechanisms in cell-to-cell communication.\n\nWhat I wanted to reflect on here are the different approaches for emergence in my artificial life works: Open-endedness and reverse engineering.\n\n- Open-ended approach: Letting evolution do its thing for open-ended discovery and allow unexpected phenomena to emerge.\n- Reverse-engineering approach: Reverse engineer a specific biological behavior.\n\nCurrently I'm working a lot on reverse engineering cell locomotion. And sometimes I'm thinking: \"is it really emergence what's happening here?\". I liked Michael Levin's remark in a podcast with Kurt Jaimungal on what emergence is to him, where he answers that central to emergence is the notion of unexpectedness. lower level phenomena giving rise to something unexpected.\n\nA lot of the compute-shader work that I'm doing (boids, physarum and cell locomotion), already have a pre-defined behavior that I want to replicate. This 'expectedness' is inherent in my top-down approach.\n\nI don't want to discount the reverse-engineering work, because the role is clear: proving that a hypothesized minimal set of mechanisms are sufficient in explaining biology.\n\nAnd while reverse engineering it, it's about uncovering essential mechanisms to enable an open-ended approach later. E.g. giving certain building blocks for an open-ended system to use. \n\nBut to me the goal is open-ended discoveries; Letting behavior arise that is not pre-defined, and letting interactions or specializations form that were not considered before.\n\n\n"}}]);
