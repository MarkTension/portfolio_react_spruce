Therefore most people will be able to be creative on the web, and make web apps with little effort. Aside from the low-quality slop that is quaranteed to flood the internet, more creative power to everyone is also a good thing.\n\nInstead of utility of the new generation of apps, I predict authenticity and design will become way more important. A human feel to everything you see, and maybe an authentic story.\n\nThe previous generation of the web was much more like a formula. Thinking along the lines of \'the perfect button\', or the perfect color scheme. The new web will have to over-compensate for all the middle of the road, low quality websites out there. I believe people will increasingly care more about authenticity, an artisinal/hand-made feeling, novelty, and the sense that you\'re entering someone\'s world when you enter a webpage or app.\n\n<p align="center">\n<img width= "50%" src="/images/walkwalk1.PNG" alt="congi im">\n</p>\n\n\n\n### Walk Walk Walk as an example\nMy iOS app called Walk Walk Walk is more a creative outlet and artistic endeavor than it is its logic. It\'s a Tamagotchi-like app that allows you to set goals for walking outside daily, and counting your steps.\n\n<p align="center">\n<img width= "50%" src="/images/walkwalk4.jpg" alt="congi im">\n</p>\n\nThe app-logic is fun, but already done before by a combination of other apps. But the style isn\'t. It doesn\'t even look like an iOS app. If you like the style, it\'s clear that the creator is likely a person you can relate to. I think people will value that more and more in the future. I\'m not saying this app will be a big hit. Maybe it will be for some people who discover that a daily walk in the sun is very enjoyable, but in this blogpost it serves as a good example.\n\n<p align="center">\n<img width= "50%" src="/images/walkwalk3.jpg" alt="congi im">\n</p>\n\nApp building should be fun, and a creative expression. A way to discover who you are through what you want to build, and what you end up building. The looks of things matter a lot, and will matter more in the years to come.\n\n'}}]);
