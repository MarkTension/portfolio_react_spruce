All cover very diverse topics; Mostly spiritual, metaphysical, or outsider ideas on the world. All question reality in one way or another.\n\nTo me, this is such a treat to the mind. To go to sleep with these big ideas. I really wake up with more excitement about life. Also my dreams seem to be more vivid and interesting. Maybe it's from the moment of higher consciousness before sleep, or the wild ideas.\n\nCan recommend it to anyone. Here's a list to get started with this endeavor:\n\n** Jung, UFOs, Ancient Civilizations, & Transcendence in a Secular World â€” Dr Bernardo Kastrup - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUFkhcw9Mn0 **\n- The idea of human meaning in metacognition that he proposes is super powerful\n- Super intrigued by the idea of a possibility of intelligent life before the dinosaurs. \n- very unique view on UAP's , based on hystorical observations and Jung.\n\n** LAMPS Panel Discussion: Psychedelics and entities. What are they and what should we do about them? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynfua0t4Tao **\n- Insane out of this world psychedelic stories and conversation about entities encounters in psychedelic realms. \n\n** Bernardo Kastrup and The Search for Meaning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zfPKSRU-RI **\n- Besides his main idea of non-material metaphysics, his idea of meaning is super interesting\n\n** Patrick Harpur | Bernardo Kastrup: Myth, Imagination & Truth - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4hEOJQpbiw **\n- Patrick harpur has very interesting views on mythology, truth, and perception, and where truth and imagination collide.\n\n** Interview | Pat Noone | Irish Fairies - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXRO2Jt-LnQ **\n- Goes really well after Patrick Harpur\n\n** Christopher M. Bache on his Journey Exploring LSD as a Practice, and Entheogens as an Actual Path - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV86_iSTEbU **\n- Bache did 74 extremely high-dose LSD trips. His experiences carry a lot of significance. One of the most interesting philosophers that took his quest for truth inwards\n\n** Lee Brown - Native American Prophecies - https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=u3mzk__aa-o **\n- Not watched yet, but apparently carries some very striking predictions.\n\nI'll update the list.
