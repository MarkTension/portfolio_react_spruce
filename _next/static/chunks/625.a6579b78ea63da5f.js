That individual thoughts are steered by larger forces that don\'t have the individual\'s best interest at heart.\nThis is the image that I get from the Borg.\nAlso with the current internet, sometimes we don\'t know how much we\'re in the flows of the bigger incentives that are at play.\nEspecially since big tech copmanies makes up a huge chunk of the forces on the internet.\n\n### The Rhizome\n\n<p align="center">\n<img width= "60%" src="/images/blogHeaders/rhizome2.webp" alt="rhizome">\n</p>\nA different analogy, coming from post-modern thinker Deleuze, is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)">Rhizome</a>. \nA rhizome is the messy underground tangle of root structures with no apparent order or coherence.\n\n"The rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo."\n\nI like this term because it looks at culture as a big emergent messy thing without the structure of one tree-trunk, like a tree has.\nThe rhizome connects any point to any other point. The internet is Rhizomatic! Make a hole in it, and it will fill up again.\n\nThe Rhizome emerges from the multiplicity of species that make it up. No hard structure is imposed.\n\n### Looking at the web\n\nBig tech funneling the internet through its own infrastructure and curation is a topic Bas and I often talk about.\nThese companies bring great services and aren\'t necessarily evil at heart. But there\'s something problematic about the potential power to control a system like the internet.\nSomething that we\'re all so deeply hooked into, controlling the streams of information that we see has huge potential for abuse.\nAny person who becomes a less actualized version of themselves because their curiosity is fed with garbage is a huge waste to humanity.\n\nIdeally there are benevolent, transparent systems in place that nourish each human\'s information intake.\nAnd lately we\'ve seen some excellent initiatives that try to do this. Open-source and open-protocol systems like Mastodon or Bluesky are good examples.\nAlso the idea of <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf">_local-first_</a> to replace _cloud-first_. The local-first paradigm definitely sound more Rhizomatic, less Borg to me.\n\nI think the current nostalgia for the unfiltered, unsmoothened 90\'s internet hints at a need for better more transparent and noursishing infrastructure like in the chaotic past.\n\nAnyway, I like these metaphores as they help navigating the software designing decision and consumer choices that lays the core for the more benevolent technology of the future.\n'}}]);
