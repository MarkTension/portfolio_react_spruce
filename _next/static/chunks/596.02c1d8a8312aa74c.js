Very single-mindedly. \nMostly many conversations on the product we're making and lots of programming.\n\nSometimes I fall prey to lazilly consuming recommended content in the evenings before bed. It's relaxing, but often also quite technology related. \n\nSometimes my world feels quite small because of this singular focussed lifestyle.\n\nSince a few weeks though, I'm keeping up a new habit:\nI lay on the floor, stretching out a bit.\n\nAnd listen to an item in a specially curated queue of out-there videos. \n\nThese videos or podcasts cover some very diverse topics. Mostly spiritual, metaphysical, or outsider ideas on the world. Most are deeply questioning reality.\n\nTo me, this is such a treat to the mind, to go to sleep with these big ideas. I really wake up with more excitement about life honestly. \n\nJust wanted to share my list to help anyone reading this get started with this fun routine:\n\n- Jung, UFOs, Ancient Civilizations, & Transcendence in a Secular World â€” Dr Bernardo Kastrup -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUFkhcw9Mn0\n- Lee Brown - Native American Prophecies - https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=u3mzk__aa-o\n- LAMPS Panel Discussion: Psychedelics and entities.
