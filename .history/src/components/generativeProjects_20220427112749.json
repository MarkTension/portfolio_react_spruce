      "description1": "This project is work that I did for Onformative. It's a reinforcement learning approach to 3D sculpting.",
      "description2": "All was done in Unity3D, and the reinforcement learning part with ml-agents. This project is still in active development",
      "description3": "The project was focused on make a sculpting in a 3D environment. Which means, getting from a 3D block to a predefined target shape by removing mass from the initial block in a smart way. The agent needs to decide how to navigate the space, which parts to remove and how. Itâ€™s basically a simulation environment with infinite data and a clear reward structure, and therefore an excellent use-case for RL. The way to make the agent learn is rewarding it the right way: give reward when extraneous mass is removed, and penalty when mass that ought to be part of the final sculpture is removed.",
